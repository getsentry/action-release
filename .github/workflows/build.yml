    # BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE creates the image in such a way that you can
    # then use --cache-from (think of a remote cache)
    # This feature can be used because of using the buildx plugin
    # In the case of the Docker builder iamge, we should always see that it's using the remote cache
    # NOTE: Sadly, the COPY line from the builder image (in the Dockerfile) always invalidates the cache,
    # thus, we do not benefit from using --cache-from. The multi-stage build still gives us a smaller footprint
    # TODO: Optimize the Dockerfile to take advantage of proper caching
