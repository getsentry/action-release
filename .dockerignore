# Docs: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file
# These files will be ignore by Docker for COPY and ADD commands when creating a build context
# In other words, if a file should not be inside of the Docker container it should be
# added to the list, otherwise, it will invalidate cache layers and have to rebuild
# all layers after a COPY command
